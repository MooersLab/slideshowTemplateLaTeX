# Template for making slideshows in LaTeX

This template has my favorite settings after about eight years of use.
I strived to make it hard to tell that the slides were made with the beamer documentclass.
I includes example slides for the following situations, which covers most scenarios:

- black bullet point lists (no green triangle for points)
- imported images
- sample tables
- code block on colored background and syntax highlighted by the minted package
- display equations

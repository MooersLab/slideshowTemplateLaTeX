# Template for making slideshows in LaTeX

This template has my favorite settings after about eight years of use.
I strived to make it hard to tell that the slides were made with the beamer document class.
I included example slides for the following situations, which cover most scenarios:

- black bullet point list (no green triangle for points)
- imported image
- sample table
- code block on colored background and syntax highlighted by the minted package
- display equations

Duplicate the kind of slide you need and delete or comment on the rest.

## Recommended workflow

- Stay organized. Create a separate folder for each platform talk or seminar in the home directory for easy access and clone this repository into it. I never give the same talk twice. For example, I create a new folder for each seminar if they are similar. I will store lectures in separate subfolders in the folder for each course.
- I will start a slideshow early to help generate new ideas through visualization. Sometimes, the slideshow precedes the drafting of a manuscript.
- git clone [Writing log template](https://github.com/MooersLab/writingLogTemplate)
- Use the writing log to record your plans, decisions, correspondence with session chairs or seminar hosts, and progress regarding slides developed, text written, and the number of times rehearsed.
- git clone  [Annotated Bibliography](https://github.com/MooersLab/annotatedBibliography) to the subfolder annotatedBibliograpy
- Use the annotated bibliography to store the Bibtex entries and notes and to cite the literature.
- If you use Overleaf, create a new project and upload the files. Set the compiler to XeLaTeX.
- If using compiles to PDF locally, use the XeLaTeX compiler.
- git clone the Overleaf project to the subfolder `ov` as a backup.
- Start brainstorming and creating!
